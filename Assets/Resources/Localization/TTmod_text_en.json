Its color depends on the thickness of this layer - the so-called. tint colors that change as the film grows (yellow, brown, cherry, purple, blue, gray).\n\nThere are the following types of bluing:\n\n    alkaline - bluing in alkaline solutions with oxidizing agents at a temperature of 135-150 ° C;\n    acid - bluing in acidic solutions by chemical or electrochemical methods;\n    thermal - oxidation of steel at high temperatures: in vapors of an ammonia-alcohol mixture at 520–880 °C, in molten salts at 400–600 °C, and also in an air atmosphere at 310–450 °C with a preliminary coating of the surface of the part with a thin layer of asphalt or oil varnish.\n\nThe coating structure is fine-crystalline, microporous. To add shine, as well as improve the protective properties of the oxide film, it is also impregnated with oil (mineral or vegetable)."
